# matrix-multiplication
This is a program for getting results of square matrix multiplication by using the different approaches, classical approach and more advanced method of multiplication, such as "Divide and Conquer", and its two version of implementation - simple recursive method and Strassen's recursive algorithm.

# How to run the project
You must use Python 3 to run the application.

If you do not want to input any additional parameters, just put your input files to the directory

./files/input

and give them the names input_a.txt and input_b.txt

After that run this program using the command:

python3 src/demo.py

If you would like to use the default settings, press the button "Enter" twice or input your paths to files in the opposite case. By default you can see the results in the file

./files/output/output.txt
